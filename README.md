# Up to Speed

Up to Speed is the training program at Mynewsdesk. This is the jQuery Mobile-powered mobile web app where users can attend events and see a list of attendees on any event.

## Examination work

This mobile web app was conceived during my examination work at Mynewsdesk. Main emphasize of the project has been to highlight the core values of the organization and the training program - to include users and create a community within the company. It's also fun, damnit!

The events are fetched with cron and attendings are synced using delayed job.

Not quite there yet, there are tons of stuff to fix before this is ready to be used out of the box, but take a look in the code if you'd like!
